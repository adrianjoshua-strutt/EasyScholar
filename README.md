# EasyScholar - A Google Scholar Scraper

`EasyScholar` is a simple library to scrape Google Scholar using publication titles.

**NOTE: This library is only for small scraping (e.g. 20 papers)**

Building on EasySchoolar I created `PublicationsToCSV`.
Given a list of publication titles it turns them into a CSV file containg more information (via BeautifulSoup).

This tool was created while writing my master thesis. I had several related work papers I needed to compare. I only had a list of publications, but needed a a .csv file enriched with information (e.g. publication date).
