# EasyScholar - A Google Scholar Miner

EasyScholar is a simple library to scrape Google Scholar using publication titles.
The tool provided is given a list of publication titles and turns them into a CSV file containg more information (via BeautifulSoup)

NOTE: This tool is only for small scraping (e.g. 20 papers).

This tool was created while writing my master thesis. I had several related work papers I needed to compare. 
I only had a list of publications, but needed a a .csv file enriched with information.
